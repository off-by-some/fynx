FynX Observable Protocols
========================

This package contains all protocol definitions for the FynX observable system.
Protocols define the interfaces that concrete implementations must follow.

Available protocols:
- Computed: Interface for computed observables
- Conditional: Interface for conditional observables
- DerivedObservable: Interface for derived observables
- Mergeable: Interface for merged observables
- ReactiveOperations: Interface for reactive operations
- TupleBehavior: Interface for tuple behavior
- Observable: Interface for primitive observables
- TransparentValue: Interface for value observables
