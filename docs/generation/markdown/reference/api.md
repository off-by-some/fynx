# API Reference

This reference provides comprehensive documentation of FynX's public API. FynX is a reactive programming library that makes your application state respond automatically to changesâ€”think of it as a spreadsheet for your code, where updating one cell automatically recalculates all the formulas that depend on it.

## A Mental Model for FynX

Before diving into the API details, it helps to understand FynX's core philosophy:

**Traditional programming is imperative**: You tell your code exactly when to update things. Change a variable here, update the UI there, recalculate this value over there. You're responsible for remembering all the connections.

**FynX is declarative**: You describe *relationships* between values, and FynX handles the updates automatically. Change a value once, and everything that depends on it updates correctly, in the right order, every time.

This mental shiftâ€”from managing updates to declaring relationshipsâ€”is what makes thinking reactively so powerful.

## Your Learning Path

FynX's API is designed to be learned progressively, with each concept building on the previous one:

1. **Start with Observables** â€” Learn to create reactive values that notify subscribers when they change
2. **Organize with Stores** â€” Group related observables into cohesive units with clean APIs
3. **Filter Conditionally** â€” Control when reactions occur based on runtime conditions
4. **Automate with Decorators** â€” Eliminate boilerplate and express reactive relationships declaratively

Each section in this reference assumes you understand the previous sections. If you encounter an unfamiliar concept, backtrack to the earlier pages.

## Core Concepts

### Observables: Reactive Values

Observables are containers for values that change over time. Unlike regular variables, they automatically notify anyone who's interested when their values change.

**[Observable](observable.md)** â€” The foundation of FynX. Create observables with `observable(initial_value)`, read them with `.value`, write them with `.set(new_value)`. Every other FynX feature builds on this simple primitive.

**[ComputedObservable](computed-observable.md)** â€” Values that automatically recalculate when their dependencies change. Create them with the `>>` operator: `full_name = (first + last) >> (lambda f, l: f"{f} {l}")`. The `>>` operator transforms observables through functions, creating a new computed observable. Alternatively, use the `.then(func)` method on observables for the same result. FynX tracks dependencies automatically and ensures computed values always stay up-to-date.

**[MergedObservable](merged-observable.md)** â€” Combine multiple observables into a single reactive tuple using the `+` operator: `position = x + y + z`. When any source changes, subscribers receive all values as a tuple. This is the foundation for reactive relationships that depend on multiple values.

**[ConditionalObservable](conditional-observable.md)** â€” Observables that emit when conditions are satisfied. Create them with the `&` operator: `valid_submission = form_data & is_valid`. This enables sophisticated reactive logic without cluttering your code with conditional checks.

**[Observable Descriptors](observable-descriptors.md)** â€” The mechanism behind Store class attributes. When you write `name = observable("Alice")` in a Store class, you're creating a descriptor that provides clean property access without `.value` or `.set()`.

**[Observable Operators](observable-operators.md)** â€” The operators (`+`, `>>`, `&`, `~`) and methods (`.then()`, `.also()`) that let you compose observables into reactive pipelines. The `>>` operator is the primary way to transform observables, passing values through functions. Understanding these operators unlocks FynX's full expressive power.

### Stores: Organizing State

While standalone observables are useful for small scripts, real applications need structure. Stores group related observables and computed values into cohesive units.

**[Store & @observable](store.md)** â€” Create Store classes that encapsulate related state. Use `@observable` to make class attributes reactive, or use `observable()` as a class attribute descriptor. This gives you clean property access: `UserStore.name = "Alice"` instead of `user_name.set("Alice")`. Stores are where FynX really shines in application development.

### Decorators: Declarative Reactions

Decorators let you declare what should happen when observables change, without manually managing subscriptions.

**[@reactive](reactive-decorator.md)** â€” Run functions automatically when dependencies change. This is how you implement side effectsâ€”logging, UI updates, API callsâ€”that should happen in response to state changes. The function runs immediately and again whenever any observable it reads changes. Use with conditional observables for event-driven reactions: `@reactive(condition & other_condition)`.

## API Quick Reference

### Creating Reactive State

```python
from fynx import observable, Store

# Standalone observables
count = observable(0)
name = observable("Alice")

# Store-based observables
class AppStore(Store):
    count = observable(0)
    name = observable("Alice")
```

### Reading and Writing

```python
# Standalone observables
current = count.value          # Read
count.set(current + 1)         # Write

# Store observables
current = AppStore.count       # Read
AppStore.count = current + 1   # Write
```

### Deriving Values

```python
# Using the >> operator (recommended)
doubled = count >> (lambda c: c * 2)
full_name = (first + last) >> (lambda f, l: f"{f} {l}")

# Using .then() method (alternative syntax)
doubled = count.then(lambda c: c * 2)
full_name = (first + last).then(lambda f, l: f"{f} {l}")
```

### Reacting to Changes

```python
# Manual subscription
count.subscribe(lambda val: print(f"Count: {val}"))

# Using @reactive decorator
@reactive(count)
def log_count(val):
    print(f"Count: {val}")

# Using @reactive with conditional observables for event-driven reactions
is_above_threshold = count >> (lambda c: c > 10)
@reactive(is_above_threshold)
def on_threshold(is_above):
    if is_above:
        print("Count exceeded 10!")
```

### Composing Observables

```python
# Merge multiple sources
position = x + y + z

# Transform values with >> operator
doubled = count >> (lambda c: c * 2)

# Or use .then() method
doubled = count.then(lambda c: c * 2)

# Filter conditionally
should_save = has_changes & is_valid

# Negate conditions
is_idle = ~is_busy
```

## Complete Example: Putting It All Together

Here's how these concepts work together in a realistic scenario:

```python
from fynx import Store, observable, reactive

class ShoppingCartStore(Store):
    # Basic reactive state
    items = observable([])
    discount_code = observable(None)

# Computed values using >> operator
subtotal = ShoppingCartStore.items >> (
    lambda items: sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)
)

discount_amount = (ShoppingCartStore.items + ShoppingCartStore.discount_code) >> (
    lambda items, code: sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items) * 0.20
    if code == "SAVE20" else 0.0
)

total = (subtotal + discount_amount) >> (
    lambda sub, disc: sub - disc
)

# Conditional observable for checkout eligibility
has_items = ShoppingCartStore.items >> (lambda i: len(i) > 0)
total_positive = total >> (lambda t: t > 0)
can_checkout = has_items & total_positive

# React to changes automatically
@reactive(total)
def update_ui_total(t):
    print(f"ðŸ’° New total: ${t:.2f}")

# React to checkout eligibility using conditional observables
@reactive(can_checkout)
def enable_checkout_button(can_checkout_val):
    if can_checkout_val:
        print("âœ… Checkout button enabled")

# Use the store
ShoppingCartStore.items = [
    {'name': 'Widget', 'price': 10.00, 'quantity': 2}
]
# Output: ðŸ’° New total: $20.00
# Output: âœ… Checkout button enabled

ShoppingCartStore.discount_code = "SAVE20"
# Output: ðŸ’° New total: $16.00
```
